After you create a Let’s Encrypt™ certificate, you must also create **TXT record** in **Intelligent DNS** to add the information given by the Let’s Encrypt™ provider.

To generate this type of certificate, you must prepare an Intelligent DNS entry on Azion and create an Azion domain.

Then, after generating the certificate, you'll return to Azion and create a record on Intelligent DNS.

## Via RTM

1. Follow the general steps described in the [How to add records](/en/documentation/products/secure/guides/add-records/) guide.
2. In **Name**, .
3. In the **Type** dropdown menu, select **TXT**.
4. In **Value**, add a text with the ACME challenge provided by the Let's Encrypt provider and the value. For example: `Deploy a DNS TXT record under the name _acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN> with the following value: ekgH9kW242Vbt99P27agtr07I09iLsiZZx`.
5. In **TTL (seconds)**, choose a value.
6. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<hosted_zone_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing zones. Copy the value of the `<id>` that you want to use.
3. Run the following `POST` request, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<hosted_zone_id>` value you copied:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns/<hosted_zone_id>/records' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--data-raw '{
    "record_type": "TXT",
    "entry": "@",
    "answers_list": [
        "Deploy a DNS TXT record under the name _acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN> with the following value: ekgH9kW242Vbt99P27agtr07I09iLsiZZx"
    ],
    "ttl": 20
}'
```

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "answers_list": [
      "Deploy a DNS TXT record under the name _acme-challenge.<YOUR_DOMAIN> with the following value: ekgH9kW242Vbt99P27agtr07I09iLsiZZx"
    ],
    "zone_id": 1234,
    "record_type": "TXT",
    "ttl": 20,
    "policy": "simple",
    "entry": "@",
    "id": 56506,
    "description": ""
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your records will be created in the hosted zone you chose.
