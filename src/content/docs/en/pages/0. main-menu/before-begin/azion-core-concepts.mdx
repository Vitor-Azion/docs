**Azion Edge Platform** is an edge-native and full-stack platform that simplifies building and running modern applications anywhere: on Azion's-operated network edge, remote devices, on-premises, or multi-cloud.

As an edge-native platform, it runs on a highly distributed network, with automatic deployment, monitoring of applications, and managing the whole CI/CD pipeline.

Azion's platform is:

- **Based on open standards**: this way, you don't need to learn proprietary software or buy new hardware.
- **Programmable**: you can bring your own code, test new features with real data, and merge code easily into production.
- **Interoperable**: Azion's platform supports different devices, systems, third-party platforms, and technologies. This way, your applications can run anywhere.
- **Agile**: NoOps and full control via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/), [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/cli/), [Terraform Provider](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/), or [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/getting-to-know-real-time-manager/), Azion's configuration interface. It also offers templates and integrations to speed up your deployment.
- **Flexible**: with the Pay-as-you-go model, you pay for exactly what you need and use.
- **Reliable**: Azion's global, distributed network with more than 100 edge locations provides a 100% network uptime.
- **Secure by design**: the platform is built to support zero-trust security models. It also offers AI-powered threat mitigation at the edge, and Security Response Teams, as well as multi-layer security with DDoS Protection Unmetered, real-time security updates, and SecOps automation. All without performance impact.
- **Compliant**: Azion is certified as a PCI DSS 4.0 Level 1 Service Provider and attested for SOC 2 Type II and SOC 3. All edge locations offer all the required compliances.

This way, Azion offers a wide range of benefits, including low latency, a distributed architecture, scalability, efficiency, real-time processing and analytics, orchestration, and seamless management, among other advantages.

Additionally, Azion has already been listed in the [Forrester New Wave Report for Edge Development Platforms](https://www.azion.com/en/blog/azion-listed-in-forrester-new-wave-edge-platforms/) (2021) and named a [Leader and Fast Mover in GigaOm Radar for Edge Platforms](https://www.azion.com/en/blog/azion-named-leader-fast-mover-gigaom-report/) (2023), being considered as "the only purpose-built edge platform whose capabilities meet all the key criteria".
