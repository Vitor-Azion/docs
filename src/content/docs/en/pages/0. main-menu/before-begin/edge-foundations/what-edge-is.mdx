**Edge computing** is a highly-distributed computing paradigm that aims to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed, typically near the "edge" of the network.

Edge computing enables the building and management of [modern applications](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/overview/) able to meet the growing demand for real-time processing, reduced latency, improved data privacy, and the ability to handle the massive amount of data generated by IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other sources.

With this approach, companies don't have to rely anymore just on a centralized cloud-based infrastructure and, consequently, it allows them to serve new use cases.

## Components of edge computing

Edge computing infrastructure is built upon four essential components. These elements collectively form the backbone of this new paradigm, enabling its capacity to deliver low-latency, high-performance applications, and reshape the digital landscape.

- **Routing**: edge computing includes state-of-the-art software-defined technology to route the requests to the network. This approach turns it into a programmable and extensible environment, able to detect users and devices routing them to the healthier and more optimal node.
- **Orchestrating**: the automation and coordination of various computing, networking, and storage resources to enable the deployment and management of workloads are essential characteristics of orchestration in the edge computing context. It involves defining and managing actions across edge nodes, ensuring the right allocation of resources at the right time, and maintaining overall integrity and efficiency.
- **Computing**: it plays a crucial role in tasks like data processing, analysis, and running software programs. In this matter, the computing is designed to operate efficiently in edge environments, delivering faster speeds and improved efficiency.
- **Observing**: edge computing provides a high capacity for monitoring and collecting data from various elements and systems to gain insights into their behavior, performance, and overall health. This data is essential for troubleshooting, performance optimization, decision-making, and real-time visibility into the state of infrastructure and applications, and, this way, maintain the reliability and security of the network.

Overall, this enables a better user experience by addressing some of the key limitations of [centralized and legacy architectures](/en/documentation/products/edge-foundations/how-edge-computing-works/#edge-vs-legacy-architectures).
