**Edge computing** is a highly-distributed computing paradigm that aims to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed, typically near the "edge" of the network.

Edge computing enables the building and management of [modern applications](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/overview/) able to meet the growing demand for real-time processing, reduced latency, improved data privacy, and the ability to handle the massive amount of data generated by IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other sources.

With this approach, companies don't have to rely anymore just on a centralized cloud-based infrastructure and, consequently, it allows them to serve new use cases.

## Components of edge

Edge computing architecture is built upon four essential components. These elements collectively form the backbone of this new paradigm, enabling its capacity to deliver low-latency, high-performance solutions and reshaping modern computing.
