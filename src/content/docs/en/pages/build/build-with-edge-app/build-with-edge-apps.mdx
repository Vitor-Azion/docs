Azion **Edge Application** allows you to configure numerous settings, from behaviors at the request-response layer to how the edge stores your cache. You may look into the reference documentation for each functionality for more information, but for now, start by creating an edge application that will serve as a blank canvas.

Have an application and want to move to the edge? [Migrate to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/). Already work with a certain framework or have an infrastructure in mind? [Check the available Templates](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/).
:::

## Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the **Add Edge Application** button.
4. Give your application a name.
5. In **Delivery Protocol**, select **HTTP**.
6. In **Ports HTTP**, keep the option **80 (Default)** selected.
7. In **Origin Type**, select **Single Origin**.
8. In **Address**, add your origin address in Host or IPv4 format. For example: `httpbin.org`.
9. In **Origin Protocol Policy**, select the option **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol**.
10. In **Host Header**, select the variable `${host}`.
11. In **Browser Cache Settings**, keep the option **Honor Origin Cache Headers** selected.
12. In **CDN Cache Settings**, keep the option **Honor Origin Cache Settings** selected.
13. In **Default TTL (seconds)**, keep the value `60`.
14. Click the **Save** button.

Now your application is built, but you cannot access it using a browser because you need to launch it through a domain. To create a domain:

15. Click the **Add Domain** button.
16. Give your domain a name.
17. In **Edge Certificate**, select the **Azion SAN** certificate.
18. In **Edge Application**, select your edge application.
19. Disable the **CNAME access only switch**. This will enable users to access your application using the `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address.
20. Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for your new domain to propagate to the edge nodes and access your `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address. You should now see your edge application online.

## Via CLI

You can also create your application via the command line interface (CLI). Visit the [CLI documentation](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/cli/) to install the **Azion CLI** on your computer.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/):

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "httpbin.org",
    "delivery_protocol": "http",
    "http_port": [80],
    "origin_type": "single_origin",
    "address": "httpbin.org",
    "origin_protocol_policy": "preserve",
    "host_header": "${host}",
    "browser_cache_settings": "honor",
    "cdn_cache_settings": "honor",
    "cdn_cache_settings_maximum_ttl": 60
}'
```

2. You'll recieve a response confirming the creation of your edge application. It should look like this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <edge_application_id>,
        "name": "httpbin.org",
        "delivery_protocol": "http",
        "http_port": [
            80
        ],
        "https_port": [
            443
        ],
        "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_3",
        "active": true,
        "debug_rules": false,
        "http3": false,
        "websocket": false,
        "supported_ciphers": "all",
        "application_acceleration": false,
        "caching": true,
        "device_detection": false,
        "edge_firewall": false,
        "edge_functions": false,
        "image_optimization": false,
        "load_balancer": false,
        "raw_logs": false,
        "web_application_firewall": false
    }
}
```

3. Copy the value from the `id` field.
4. Run the next `POST` command to create a domain, replacing the `<edge_application_id>` variable with the `id` of your edge application from the previous response:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "httpbin.org - domain",
    "cname_access_only": false,
    "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>
}'
```

5. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <domain_id>,
        "name": "httpbin.org - domain",
        "cnames": [],
        "cname_access_only": false,
        "digital_certificate_id": null,
        "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>,
        "is_active": true,
        "domain_name": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net",
        "environment": "production",
        "is_mtls_enabled": false,
        "mtls_verification": "enforce",
        "mtls_trusted_ca_certificate_id": null,
        "edge_firewall_id": null
    }
}
```

6. Since the `domain_name` received in the response carries your application's Azion domain as a string, you need to wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate. Then, paste the value within double quotes (`"`) in your browser to access your application.
