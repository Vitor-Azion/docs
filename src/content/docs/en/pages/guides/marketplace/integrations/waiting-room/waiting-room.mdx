**Upstash Waiting Room** is an integration that helps you manage traffic surges and prevent overload on your websites and applications. The integration uses a *first-in, first-out* approach and leverages on Azion **Edge Firewall**, creating a waiting room to control and redirect access according to your parameters. The waiting room implementation also uses *Redis* as a state store.

When a request arrives at your website, the Edge Firewall executes the integration, assigning an identifier to the request. If there's availability on your website, the request has access to your content; if not, the request is redirected to the waiting room, receiving a number in the row to access. You can monitor the activity through the **Upstash Dashboard**.

## Requirements

To start using this integration, you need to:

- Create an [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/login).

2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Enable the **Edge Functions** switch in the **Edge Firewall Modules**.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function

1. Click the **Add Function** button.

3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Waiting Room** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function's source-code and two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source-code, but won't be able to change it.

4. In the **Args** tab, you'll pass your Upstash credentials and your variables:

```json
{
  "url": "https://region-database.upstash.io",
  "token": "YourUpstashToken",
  "ttl": 10,
  "capacity": 2
}
```

Where:

| Variable | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `url` | URL string to connect on Upstash Redis. Go to... Example: `zzz` |
| `token` | Token to access the Upstash Redis database. Go to... |
| `ttl` | Maximum time, in seconds, that a user can stay on your website. Example: `2` |
| `capacity` | Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed on your website. Example: `10` |
