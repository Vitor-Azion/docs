> Have an application and want to move to the edge? [Migrate to Azion](link_migrate).

Azion **Edge Application** allows you to configure numerous settings, from behaviors at the request-response layer to how the edge stores your cache. You may look into the reference documentation for each functionality for more information, but for now, let's start by creating an edge application that will serve as a blank canvas.

> If you already work with a certain framework or have an infrastructure in mind, check the available [Templates](link_templates).

## Building your application

The first thing you'll need to have an edge application is an [Azion account](link_accounts). Once you have your credentials, you can choose whether you want to create your applicationt through [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](link_rtm) or [generate a personal token](link_generate_token) to make changes to your account via developer tools, such as the [Azion CLI](link_cli) or the [Azion API](link_api).

### Real-Time Manager

Starting from the Real-Time Manager main page, to create a new edge application:

1. Access RTM.
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the **Add Edge Application** button.
4. Give your application a name.

The following sections will walk you through each configuration option in the application creation process.

#### Main settings

This section defines how your application will be delivered. Customize these options later by following the instructions in [Configuring your main settings](link_config_app).

1. In **Delivery Protocol**, select **HTTP**.
2. In **Ports HTTP**, keep the option **80 (Default)** selected.

#### Origin

Here you'll define where your content will be retrieved from. For the purposes of this guide, the HTTPBin website will be the source of content for the application. This setting can be customized later in [Working with origins](link_work_origins).

1. In **Origin Type**, select **Single Origin**.
2. In **Address**, add `httpbin.org`.
3. In **Origin Protocol Policy**, select the option **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol**.
4. In **Host Header**, select the variable `${host}`.

#### Cache settings

This is the section where you define how your application handles cache, be it caching at the edge or at the user's browser. In [Tuning your Cache Settings](link_cache_settings), you'll be able to further customize these and other settings.

1. In **Browser Cache Settings**, keep the option **Honor Origin Cache Headers** selected.
2. In **CDN Cache Settings**, keep the option **Honor Origin Cache Settings** selected.
3. In **Default TTL (seconds)**, keep the value `60`.
4. Click the **Save** button.

#### Connecting to a domain

Now your application is built, but you cannot access it via a browser because you need to launch it through a domain.

When you create a domain at Azion and associate it to an edge application, you are given an automatically address that you can use or share to see your edge application online.

> To customize your domain address, add extra CNAMEs, visit [Work with Domains](link_work_with_domains).

To create a domain:

1. Click the **Add Domain** button.
2. Give your domain a name.
3. In **Edge Certificate**, select the **Azion SAN** certificate.
4. In **Edge Application**, select your edge application.
5. Disable the **CNAME access only switch**. This will enable users to access your application using the `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Wait some minutes for your new domain to propagate to the edge nodes and access your `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address. You should now see your edge application online.

### CLI

You can also create your application via the command line interface (CLI). Visit the [CLI documentation](link_cli) to install the **Azion CLI** on your computer.

### API

Azion provides you an extensive API specification and documentation of its platform and features. This guide provides you with a sequence of Client URL (cURL) commands you can run in your machine's terminal, or in an API platform of your choosing, and execute tasks to have your edge application up and running.

Before you run a request through the Azion API, you must authenticate your identity using a **Personal token**. The Azion API adopts the `Authorization` header as a mechanism for user authentication, where your personal token is sent as a value. Please [generate a personal token](link_personal_tokens) before proceeding with any API requests.

To create an edge application via API:

1. Run the following cURL command in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your personal token:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "New Edge Application",
    "delivery_protocol": "http",
    "http_port": [80],
    "origin_type": "single_origin",
    "address": "httpbin.org",
    "origin_protocol_policy": "preserve",
    "host_header": "${host}",
    "browser_cache_settings": "honor",
    "cdn_cache_settings": "honor",
    "cdn_cache_settings_maximum_ttl": 60
}'
```

2. You'll recieve a response confirming the creation of your edge application. It should look like this:

```json
```

3. Copy the value from the `id` field.
4. Run the next command to create a domain, replacing the `{{edge_application_id}}` variable with the `id` of your edge application:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "New Domain",
    "cname_access_only": true,
    "edge_application_id": {{edge_application_id}}
}'
```

5. You'll receive the following response:

```json
```

6. Since the `domain_name` received in the response carries your application's Azion domain as a string. Wait some minutes for the changes to propagate and paste the value within double quotes (`"`) in your browser to access your application.
