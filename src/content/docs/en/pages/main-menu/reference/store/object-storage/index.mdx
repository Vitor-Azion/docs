Azion **Object Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate object storage with the Azion Edge Computing Platform using the S3 standard. Buckets can be used as origins for edge applications or as directories for real-time object upload.

Alongside bucket creation, you possess complete control over storage allocation. This includes management of read/write permissions and the ability to upload, change, and delete objects.

:::note
This feature is available via the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com), [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/overview/), and [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).

## Buckets

Buckets are the system used to organize stored objects, or files. Similar to folders, buckets are the top-level containers to store objects. All buckets created with Azion **Object Storage** are stored in the *us-west* cloud server.

Since bucket names identify buckets, each bucket should have a unique name. The name can contain alphanumeric characters and dash (`-`). Best practices for naming buckets include specifying what types of objects are stored and the type of permissions for the objects. For example, a bucket for an edge application `Banking App` in read-only mode could be named `banking-app-ro`.

---

## Permissions

Actions involving buckets, such as uploading, listing, and deleting objects, always require authorization. In addition to the required authentication through the Azion account, these actions are managed by the bucket's **Permissions**.

The permissions available are:

- **Read-only**: objects in the bucket can only be read but not modified.
- **Read-write**: objects in the bucket can be modified.

Personal and sensitive information shouldn't be uploaded to the bucket or in object names since S3 buckets don't meet privacy protection requirements.

---

## Origin

**Object Storage** can be used as an [origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#object-storage) in Azion **Edge Application** to retrieve the content of an edge application from a bucket.

You can determine if the content is retrieved from the root of the bucket or from a **Prefix**, or path, within the bucket.
