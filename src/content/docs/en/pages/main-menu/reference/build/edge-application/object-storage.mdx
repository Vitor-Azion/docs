Azion **Object Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate file storage with the Azion Edge Computing Platform using the S3 standard. Buckets can be used as origins for Edge Applications or as directories for real-time file upload.

In addition to creating, modifying, and deleting buckets, you have full control over storage use, allowing you to manage read and write permissions.
