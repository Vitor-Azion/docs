Azion **Object Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate file storage with the Azion Edge Computing Platform using the S3 standard. Buckets can be used as origins for Edge Applications or as directories for real-time file upload.

In addition to creating, modifying, and deleting buckets, you have full control over storage use, allowing you to manage read and write permissions.

## Region

The objects are stored in a us-east server.

## Limits

Each Azion account is limited to 100 buckets per account. Each Azion account is also limited to 100.000.000 files per account.
