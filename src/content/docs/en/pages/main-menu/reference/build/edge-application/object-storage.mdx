Azion **Object Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate file storage with the Azion Edge Computing Platform using the S3 standard. Buckets can be used as origins for edge applications or as directories for real-time file upload.

Alongside bucket creation, you possess complete control over storage allocation. This enables management of read/write permissions and the ability to upload, change, and delete objects.

:::note
This feature is available via the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com), [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/overview/), and [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).

## Buckets

Buckets are the system used to organize stored objects, or files. Similar to folders, buckets are the top-level storage containers where files are uploaded. All buckets created with Azion Object Storage are stored in the *us-west* cloud server.

Since bucket names identify buckets, each bucket should have a unique name. No special characters aside from dash (`-`) are allowed. Best practices for naming buckets include specifying what types of files are stored and the type of permissions for the files. For example, a bucket for an edge application `Banking App` in read-only mode could be named `banking-app-ro`.

---

## Permissions

Actions involving buckets, such as uploading, listing, and deleting files, always require authorization. This can come in the form of **Permissions** and Azion account **Authentication**.

The permissions available are:

- **Read-only**: files in the bucket can only be read but not modified.
- **Read-write**: files in the bucket can be modified.

Personal and sensitive information shouldn't be uploaded to the bucket or in file names as S3 buckets don't meet privacy protection requirements.

---

## Origin

**Object Storage** can be used as an [origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#object-storage) in Azion **Edge Application** to retrieve the content of an edge application from a bucket.

You can determine if the content is retrieved from the root bucket or from a **Prefix**, or path, within the bucket.
