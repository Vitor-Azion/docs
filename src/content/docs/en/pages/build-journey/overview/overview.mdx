Azion Build products are your starting point for utilizing the power of edge computing in your applications.

**Edge Application** allows you to build applications closer to end users, offering low latency processing at the edge. When you build an edge application, you can determine the origin of your content and configure the domain that will be used to deliver your application to end users. Through the reverse proxy architecture, the edge processes user requests and maintains cached data, decentralizing object storage and optimizing data transfer rates and efficiency. This scalability allows you to adapt to the growth of traffic demand without overloading your infrastructure and reducing maintenance costs.

Azion provides a range of tools to configure your application at the edge: 

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com): provides a user-friendly interface to configure your application and monitor data.
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/cli/): enables the team to interact with Azion's system directly from the command line interface.
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com): allows you to integrate and automate application deployment, scaling, and monitoring processes.
- [Terraform](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/): integrate your infrastructure with Azion using Terraform.

When you build an edge application, you can determine where your content will be retrieved from and configure the domain that will be used to deliver your application to your end-users.
